								<h3>Chinese restaurants in Paris are striving to tackle its image issues. While deep cleavages still separate different customer groups from one another, some restaurateurs are looking for ways to create a new face of Chinese cuisine, one that organically combines Chinese culinary traditions and French culture, in quest of better food.</h3>
								<p><span class="firstcharacter">L</span>ike many Chinese restaurants in Paris, Au Piment du centre, located in the city center, has two sets of menu. One - voluminous, illustrated and obviously designed for Chinese-speaking customers - offers a great variety of dishes. The other, laminated and layd out on a single page, provides much more restricted choices, and has a minimalistic, typically Parisian bistro design.</p>
								<p>Just as its name indicates, au Piment du centre (or “Chilli Pepper at the Center” in English) is known for its spicy and savory Sichuanese food, one of the four traditional schools of Chinese cuisine. Renowned dishes such as <b>Kung Pao Chicken</b> (stir-fried chicken thigh dice served with peanuts, green onion and dried chilli peppers) and <b>Yu Xiang Rou Si</b> (sauteed pork served with a fish-tasting sauce made with pickled vegetable and aromatic herbs)  are must-haves for most Chinese customers, but could intimidate their French counterparts who are not used to this type of cooking, if it is known to them at all.</p>
								<p>The definition of “good Chinese food” varies greatly among different clienteles. For a long time, Chinese food was considered by Western consumers  as an unhealthy low-end fast food with questionable hygiene conditions. In recent years, though, the situation has been evolving due to China’s burgeoning economy and its people’s growing purchasing power. Chinese restaurateurs overseas have sniffed considerable opportunities in addressing this emerging market.</p>
								<p>The manager of Au Piment du Centre, Li Xi, sees in his separate menus policy  a core strategy to address the two divergent customer segments. “Half of our clients are Chinese tourists and students. It is a giant market we cannot ignore, so our dishes must first taste good to them”, he explains, referring to a less price-sensitive generation who seeks familiar dining experiences in a faraway land.
								</p>
								<p>For business student Mao Jingxi and trainee French teacher Wu Yurong, restaurants the likes of Au Piment du Centre are a good remedy for homesickness, even though the dishes here don’t taste exactly like home. “My stomach still misses the flavor of home no matter how it is interpreted”, says Jingxi, between bites, sitting in a Sichuanese restaurant with her college time girlfriend.</p>
								<p>The two 24-year-old food-savvy girls from Chongqing, one of the two hubs of Sichuanese cuisine, have grown “lenient” on Chinese restaurants in Paris despite inevitable compromises in taste, since even in Shanghai, where they went to university together, “Sichuanese cuisine is modified to fit the local palate”.</p>

								<div class="iframe-container">

								</div>
								<p></p>
								<p>To address the French audience, Mr Li prefers holding out a specific menu, instead of “compromising the overall cooking quality”. “We cannot ignore the local customers, either. So in certain ways we have to give in to established stereotypes and offer dishes they are comfortable and familiar with”, he concedes.
								</p>
								<p>Localized Chinese food in Paris doesn’t look much different from that in other parts of the world. One would happily go to an Asian restaurant, order a starter dish consisting of Vietnamese nem and Japanese gyoza with Thai Sriracha sauce, not knowing where these products actually come from, then instagram about a “lovely experience having a Chinese dinner”.</p>
								<p>Such has been the case of Frederic, a long-time sinophile and food lover. The 46-year-old man from Normandy has been eating Chinese food since his schooldays. In his kitchen, he has everything necessary for a descent homemade Chinese supper: various kinds of soy sauces, amber-colored Shaoxing rice liquor, even a steam cooker.</p>
								<p>But a connoisseur like Frederic checks the “stereotype boxes”, too. For a long time he would only go to Asian diners for nem or so-called Cantonese (or so is it called) rice takeouts. “Later I realized the ‘classics’ I used to eat werenasn’t necessarily or not at all Chinese”, he jokes, “and this could make a Chinese person laugh”.</p>

								<p>At Au Piment du Centre, he two contrasting customer segments hardly intersect one another, and Mr Li Xi’s strategy seems to be working very well. During mealtime, it is almost always difficult to get a table in the restaurant, where Chinese customers gather around tables sharing copious dishes while local French clients enjoy snacks and drinks on the terrace.</p>
								<p>Just like restaurants themselves, rating websites also tackle various customer demographic groups, and one can find roughly as many Chinese restaurants on New Savour, founded and used by the overseas Chinese community in Paris, as on La Fourchette and Trip Advisor combined, which target respectively a more local and global audience. The rating websites also tend to focus on different categories of Chinese restaurants to better cater to the needs of their users, and merely 42 of all the thousands of restaurants appear on all three platforms.</p>

								<p class="source">Sources: Trip Advisor, New Savour, La Fourchette</p> -->
								<p>More compelling are customer reviews on each websites. Top-rated restaurants on New Savour don’t seem to appeal as much to non-Chinese clients, and vice versa. While Mr Li’s approach proves to be a common strategy, all restaurateurs are not so ambitious to target the entire customer spectrum. Restaurant Le Bourgeon in the ninth arrondissement, for example, chooses not to have an alternative menu. Its photo album-like menus are bilingual, but the French translation of poetic and sometimes esoteric Chinese dish names sounds rather ponderous. Still, the two-storey restaurant has quite some customers at lunchtime on a weekday -, and only one of them is French.
								</p>
								<p>A complicated past has planted in French people’s minds a deep-rooted image of “Chinese food”. As food sociologist Jean-Pierre Poulain puts it: “ in such places, the Asian newcomer finds himself, perhaps even more so than a Westerner, in an exotic universe”.</p>
								<p>The first recorded two Chinese restaurants to open in Paris date back to over a century ago, but it was not until the post-war era that massive numbers of immigrants from China and former French colonies in Southeastern Asia started to arrive in Paris and make a living running a restaurant. By the middle 1960s, the Latin Quarter had become saturated with Chinese - or so were they branded - restaurants, and restaurateurs began to expand their business to other neighborhoods. In 1960, the Interior Ministry of France estimated the number of Chinese restaurants in the capital to be 97. In merely thirty years, it grew to 728, or nearly 1400 in the Greater Parisian Area, according to a census conducted by the Guide of the Chinese Community in 1991.</p>
								
								<p>Most of these places were modest and popular diners. Fine dining restaurants did exist, but were rare. Authenticity and “good tastes” were unattainable goals for such modest canteens, as mundane ingredients at home immediately became expensive and scarce exotism in a new country, let alone that most immigrants were in a financially difficult situation upon their arrival. Opening a restaurant thus turned out to be a good solution to both making ends meet and relieving homesickness. In the 1990s, over a half of all economic activities of the Chinese diaspora in Paris involved catering business.</p>

								<p class="source">Sources: Trip Advisor, New Savour</p> -->
								<p>Low-end diners dominated the Chinese food industry in the French capital, until a major game changer - middle-class Chinese tourists and students, came on the scene. An essential criterion of these new clients is that the food should remind them oftaste like home: China in the twenty-first century.</p>
								<p>Colossal changes are being made in the country’s catering sector -- from audaciously flavored Sichuanese food to exquisite Cantonese dim sum and chic tea drinks -- things that “old overseas Chinese” restaurateurs generally know little about since they left the country decades ago and that they are actually more devoted to the local clientele.</p>
								<p>The new connoisseur foodies are not easy to please, and challenges to maintain authenticity don’t become any easier in an era of Internet and cross-border E-commerce, as flavours depend not only on ingredients, but also the climate where the food is made.</p>					<p>Chef You works in a Sichuanese bistro in the fifth Arrondissement in Paris. Back in China, he ran a hotel restaurant and supervised upon a dozen of cooks and their kitchen’s secret sauces and pickles. “Such flavors are simply impossible to reproduce in France, no matter what I try”, he laments, referring to a special vegetarian fish-tasting flavor in the Sichuanese cuisine called Yu Xiang that requires local pickled chilli pepper made with grain liquor and several fragrant herbs. In most Asian diners, this flavor is frequently replaced by lavish dose of vinegar and sugar, and this alternative has no difficulty targeting admirers.
								</p>		
									
								<p>Besides the real-or-fake cleavage, a new school of Chinese food is emerging: the Franco-Chinese fusion. And instead of treating Chinese and French customers differently, some restaurateurs are looking for ways to organically combine the two countries' culinary traditions and offer food acceptable to a more cosmopolitan and mixed clientele.</p>
								<p>Xuan Yan and her husband are testing this new path in their restaurant Le Granite located in the fifteenth arrondissement. Their slogan: “the meeting of French culture and Chinese taste”, reflected by the combination of trendy Sichuanese dishes and French wine. 
								<p>Ms Xuan keeps the venue’s decor intact just like they rented it four years ago. “This place used to be a two-star Michelin restaurant, and many celebrities have been here”, she says, pointing to photos of former Prime Minister of France Jean-Pierre Raffarin and late Colombian Nobel-winning writer Garcia Gabriel Marquez, “and I want to inherit its charm”.</p>
								<p>While the couple don’t have much experience running a restaurant, they clearly know what it takes to be good cross-cultural communicators. Ms Xuan herself was chief representative of the Nordic Tourism Office in Beijing, and her husband worked as a diplomatic delegate for the Chinese government. When he was transferred to Paris on a mission, she decided to tag along and pursue her “romantic dreams about France every woman has”.</p>
								<p>For a whole year she ran this place like a French bistro and learnt her hospitality management lessons in practice and deficit. They then decided to convert it into what they knew better about and what the neighborhood didn’t have: a chic but affordable Chinese restaurant. Now that Le Granite has a stable cash flow, Ms Xuan can devote herself to another lifelong dream of hers: become a salon hostess. Every couple of weeks she gathers Chinese scholars and students in France and their French counterparts to exchange about a variety of topics: poetry, art and wine tasting, to name a few. “I’d like my restaurant to become a place for great minds to meet in”, she adds.</p>
								<p>Fully integrating to the local community can't be done with ease, and to target a broader potential client group means stepping out the comfort zone, develop new menus and advertise on more platforms rather than merely on Chinese language websites. Growing numbers of Chinese restaurant pages on La Fourchette and Facebook are certainly a positive sign.</p>
								<p>Despite this new tendency, though, Chinese cuisine still has a long way to go in its branding and image building process, as stereotypes won’t just disappear overnight. Ms Xuan remembers attending compulsory hygiene conferences before her restaurant kicked off. “Almost all the counterexamples the Health Inspection Bureau showed us were Chinese restaurants. I can’t deny that they do exist, but I felt ashamed watching with others.”</p> <p>Not long ago, in New York City, a white woman and her Chinese bistro “Lucky Lee’s” have been pushed to the cusp of public discussions after she publicized the concept of “clean” Chinese food. It remains debatable if she truly meant to make a racist insult, but the incident demonstrates to which point Chinese cuisine still needs to deal with its image issues.</p>
								<p>Chinese cuisine is certainly on an ascendant trend, after all, as China’s economic boom continues. Gastronomy is an emblematic part of what the country’s has to offer to world, because. Just like how Ms Xuan thinks of her new career: “food is the best cultural diplomat”. <span class="signature"> ✾ Zhao Yingke</span></p>
